Type Casting 


PRE-REQUISTE CONCEPTS :
DATA TYPES
Every thing is python is object orirented  


What Exactly is Type Casting?

Type Casting simply means converting one data type to another .
In laymenn terms  we can say that converting one form of data into another.
In python there are two types of conversion.

for instance:




Explaination:

Why we need it?

As a programmer we come across many real life problems that requires different kinds of data to be handled 
so in that case if we dont perform conversion that certainly would cause hinderance.

for instance:




Explaination:

Types: 

1.Implicit conversion
2.Explicit conversion


Implicit conversion:

In this type of conversion the task of conversion in handled my python itself.
As there is a concept known as norrowing and widening in data types ,so it follows that heirachy 



for instance:





Explaination:






Explicit conversion:
The name itself explains that the conversion that can be user specific.
Imagine a scenario :
Where we need to extract prices of different grocery items but the problem is that the content is in text form 
so in order  to extract its price we need  convert the desire data into float(like 22.0).
Explicit conversion comes for the rescue.

for instance:




Explaination:

Basic Types and their functionalities:


In python basic data types are integers ,strings and floats.
Lets us we first  discuss about integers ,
These store numeric type data like 1,3 etc.


for instance:




Explaination:

Integers:In python Integers are referred using "int"
